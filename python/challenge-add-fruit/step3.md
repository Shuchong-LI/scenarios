# Check Collision 

## TODO Blocks
There are two TODO blocks in the code:

## 1. Check collision with fruit
The first TODO block is in the `check_collision` method. This method is called by the `update` method, and it checks if the snake's head collides with the fruit. If the snake eats the fruit, the fruit's position is randomized, and a block is added to the snake's body. 

The TODO block in this method is to check if the snake's head collides with the fruit object. To do this, you can check if the position of the fruit object matches the position of the snake's head. If there is a collision, you should randomize the position of the fruit object and add a block to the snake's body.


## 2. Check collision with snake body
The second TODO block is also in the `check_collision` method. This block checks if the fruit collides with any of the blocks in the snake's body, except for the head. If  there is a collision, the fruit's position is randomized.
