# Add Fruit Graphics

The files in '/home/labex/project'are already prepared for you.
  
## TODO blocks

There is only one TODO block in the code:

```
# TODO : Add fruit graphics
apple = None
```

This block is responsible for loading the fruit image that will be displayed on the screen. 

## Requirements

* Load the image file `apple.png` using the `pygame.image.load()` function.
* Ensure that the image file `apple.png` is located in the `Graphics` directory in the same directory as the game file.
* If you are having trouble displaying the image, check that the Pygame installation is correct and that the file path is correct.
