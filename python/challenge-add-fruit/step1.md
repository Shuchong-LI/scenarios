## TODO blocks

There is only one TODO block in the code:

```
# TODO : Add fruit graphics
apple = None
```

This block is responsible for loading the fruit image that will be displayed on the screen. Here are some guidance for completing this TODO block:

* Ensure that the image file 'apple.png' is located in the 'Graphics' directory in the same directory as the game file.
* If you want to use a different image for the fruit, replace 'apple.png' with the filename of the new image.
* Make sure the image file has a transparent background so that it blends well with the game's background.
* If you are having trouble displaying the image, check that the Pygame installation is correct and that the file path is correct.
