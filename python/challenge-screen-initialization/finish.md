# Summary
The code initializes Pygame, sets up the game window, and creates a clock object to keep track of the frame rate. The game loop runs indefinitely until the user closes the game window, and updates the screen at a rate of 150 milliseconds per frame. There are four TODO blocks that need to be completed to customize the game: choosing the cell size, the number of cells, the screen size, and the screen color.
