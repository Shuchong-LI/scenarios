# Screen Initialization

We have created a Python file `snake_screen_init.py` for you.This is a Python code that uses the Pygame library to create a game loop. The code initializes Pygame, sets up the game window, and creates a clock object to keep track of the frame rate. The game loop runs indefinitely until the user closes the game window, and updates the screen at a rate of 150 milliseconds per frame.
