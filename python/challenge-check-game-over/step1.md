## TODO Blocks

There is one TODO block in this code:

* `# TODO: reset snake`: This comment indicates that there is code missing, and the snake needs to be reset.

To complete the `TODO` block:

* Define the starting position of the snake's body by creating a list of `Vector2` objects.
* Define the starting direction of the snake by creating a `Vector2` object with both `x` and `y` components set to zero.
