# Solution

```python
	def draw_snake(self):
		self.update_head_graphics()
		self.update_tail_graphics()

		for index,block in enumerate(self.body):
			x_pos = int(block.x * cell_size)
			y_pos = int(block.y * cell_size)
			block_rect = pygame.Rect(x_pos,y_pos,cell_size,cell_size)

			if index == 0:
				screen.blit(self.head,block_rect)
			elif index == len(self.body) - 1:
				screen.blit(self.tail,block_rect)
			else:
				previous_block = self.body[index + 1] - block
				next_block = self.body[index - 1] - block
				if previous_block.x == next_block.x:
					screen.blit(self.body_vertical,block_rect)
				elif previous_block.y == next_block.y:
					screen.blit(self.body_horizontal,block_rect)
				else:
					if previous_block.x == -1 and next_block.y == -1 or previous_block.y == -1 and next_block.x == -1:
						screen.blit(self.body_tl,block_rect)
					elif previous_block.x == -1 and next_block.y == 1 or previous_block.y == 1 and next_block.x == -1:
						screen.blit(self.body_bl,block_rect)
					elif previous_block.x == 1 and next_block.y == -1 or previous_block.y == -1 and next_block.x == 1:
						screen.blit(self.body_tr,block_rect)
					elif previous_block.x == 1 and next_block.y == 1 or previous_block.y == 1 and next_block.x == 1:
