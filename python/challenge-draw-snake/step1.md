# Load Images and Initialize the Snake's Body

We have created the python file `snake_draw_snake.py` for you.This code defines a class called `SNAKE` which is responsible for loading images of the snake in various positions and initializing the snake's body.

The TODO blocks in the code are:

* TODO: Load the snake graphics: Here you need to load the images of the snake in various positions. The images are located in the 'Graphics' folder and have names such as `head_up.png`, `head_down.png`, `tail_up.png`, etc. Use the `pygame.image.load()` function to load each image and store them in variables such as `self.head_up`.
* TODO: Initialize the snake body: Here you need to initialize the snake's body by creating a list of `Vector2` objects. Each `Vector2` object represents a segment of the snake's body. The initial position of the snake's head and two body segments are given in the code. You need to create the remaining body segments.
