# Draw Snake

We provide a python file `snake_draw_snake.py`that defines a SNAKE class for drawing a snake using Pygame. The class has a constructor that loads all the images for the snake's head, tail, and body. It also initializes the snake's body and direction. The `draw_snake()` method draws the snake on the screen. The `update_head_graphics()` method updates the snake's head image based on the direction of the snake. The `update_tail_graphics()` method updates the snake's tail image based on the direction of the snake.
