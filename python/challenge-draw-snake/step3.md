# Draw the Snake

There is another method called `draw_snake` which is responsible for drawing the snake on the screen using Pygame. It updates the graphics for the head and tail of the snake and then iterates through each block of the snake's body to determine which image to use for each block based on its position relative to the blocks before and after it.

## TODO Blocks

* TODO: Draw the snake.
  This block is the main task that needs to be completed in this method. To do this, the graphics for the snake's head and tail are updated and then the method iterates through each block in the snake's body to determine which image to use for each block based on its position relative to the blocks before and after it.

## Requirements

- You need to define `x_pos` and `y_pos` variables to store the position of the block.
- You need to use `blit()` method to draw the snake on the screen.
