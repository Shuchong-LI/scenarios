# Handling Head and Tail

Now you are supposed to implement the two methods `update_head_graphics()` and `update_tail_graphics()` which deal with updating the graphics for the snake head and tail.

* TODO in `update_head_graphics()`: This method updates the graphics for the snake head based on the relationship between the first two segments of the snake's body. You need to implement the code that selects the appropriate head graphic (out of four possible head graphics) based on the relative positions of the first two segments. For example, if the second segment is to the right of the first segment, you should use the left-facing head graphic.

* TODO in `update_tail_graphics()`: This method updates the graphics for the snake tail based on the relationship between the last two segments of the snake's body. You need to implement the code that selects the appropriate tail graphic (out of four possible tail graphics) based on the relative positions of the last two segments. For example, if the second-to-last segment is to the right of the last segment, you should use the left-facing tail graphic.
