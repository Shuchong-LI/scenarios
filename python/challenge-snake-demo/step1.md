# Project Demo

The following are the main requirements for the project:

The game should be implemented using Python and the Pygame library.
The game should be played on a grid, with the player controlling a snake that moves around and eats food.
The snake should grow in length as it eats, and the player should lose if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
The game should have a user interface that displays the score, the game grid, and any other relevant information.
The game should have different levels of difficulty, with the speed of the snake increasing as the player progresses through the levels.
The game should have sound effects and music to enhance the user experience.
The game should have a high score system that records the top scores achieved by players.
The project should be well-documented with clear explanations of the code and the game mechanics.
Overall, the goal of this project is to create a fun and engaging version of the classic Snake game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
