# Snake Demo

Snake is a classic video game that originated in the 1970s and gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s. The game involves controlling a snake that moves around a grid, eating food and growing in length. The player must avoid the walls and the snake's own body while attempting to eat as much food as possible. The game is known for its simple yet addictive gameplay, and it has been ported to numerous platforms over the years.

The objective of this project is to create a digital version of the classic Snake game using Python. The game will be played on a grid, with the player controlling a snake that moves around and eats food. The snake will grow in length as it eats, and the player will lose if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

The game will be implemented using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. The project will involve designing the game mechanics, implementing the game logic, and creating a user interface for the game.
