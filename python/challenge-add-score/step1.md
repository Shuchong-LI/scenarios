# Add the Game Font

## 2. List of TODO Blocks and Guidance
There is only one TODO block in this code, which is as follows:

### TODO: Add game font.
To complete this TODO, you need to follow these steps:
- Find or create a font file that you want to use for the score display. In this case, the file is called "`PoetsenOne-Regular.ttf`" and it is located in a directory called "`Font`".
- Make sure that the file path in the code matches the actual location of the font file on your computer. If the file is not in the specified directory or has a different name, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
- Adjust the font size to your liking. In this case, the font size is set to 25.

Once you have completed these steps, the custom font will be loaded and used to display the score on the screen.
