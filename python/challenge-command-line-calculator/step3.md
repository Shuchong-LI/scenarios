# Output Management

After the last step, you have a working calculator. However, the output is not very user-friendly. You need to improve the output management.

## TODO

* Improve the output management.

## Requirements
* Use the `print()` function to print the result.
* If the user uses the `--add` argument, print the result in the following format:
    `{arg1} + {arg2} = {result}`.
* If the user uses the `--subtract` argument, print the result in the following format:
    `{arg1} - {arg2} = {result}`.
* If the user uses the `--multiply` argument, print the result in the following format:
    `{arg1} * {arg2} = {result}`.
* If the user uses the `--divide` argument, print the result in the following format:
    `{arg1} / {arg2} = {result}`. 
* The `arg1`, `arg2`, and `result` should be replaced with the actual values and there should be sapces before and after the `+` , `-` , `*` , `/` and `=` signs.
