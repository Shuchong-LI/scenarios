# Automate Webpage Opening and Closing

Web browsers are an essential part of our daily lives, and we use them for everything from browsing the web to online shopping, social media, and more. As a Python developer, you can use the `webbrowser` module to automate the process of opening a webpage in your default web browser.

In this challenge, you'll write a Python program that opens a web page and automatically closes the web browser after a specified amount of time. The program should have an option to open the page in a new tab or window.
